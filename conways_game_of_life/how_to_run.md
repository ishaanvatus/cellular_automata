# Dependencies
ffmpeg, a linux environment

_P.S you could totally run this on Windows if you can convert the shell script into a bash script, and recompile using a MinGW or something similar_

# Command-line usage

./animate.sh gif\_width gif\_height scale number\_of\_tick/generations

This will give you a gif file "conways\_game\_of\_life.gif" and "heatmap.pbm"
